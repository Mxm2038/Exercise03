## Tables

The objective of this task is to reviewing some of the concepts we have previously covered and add to your HTML knowledge by building tables.

You are not expected to complete this in one session. What you do not finish in class, spend time practicing at home. Always start from the beginning. **Do not copy and paste code; always type it in by hand.**

## Instructions

Clone this repository by clicking the "Clone or Download" button, then select "Download ZIP".

Included in the directory on your computer are the following files:

- 2016-election.txt
- README.md (this file)
- example.png

### Here is what you need to do

**All work needs to be done in the `exercise-03` folder.** (It may be named `exercise-03-master`.)

1. Create an html page. Call it `index.html`. Create the document structure for your web page. (This should be easy by now.)

2. Mark up the content as described.

  - Paragraphs are ... paragraphs.

  - Names of individuals are strongly emphasized on first reference in the text.

  - "2016 Presidential Election" is the page title and highest-level heading.

  - "Candidates at a Glance" and "Debates" are second-level headings.

3. Build the tables.

  - The first table is a basic table. Text displayed in bold should be a table heading. All other information should be considered table data.

  - Provide a link to each candidate's web site in the "Candidates" table. (Do not worry about link color; blue means a link has not been visited, purple means it has been visited.)

  - The second table is a complex table; there will be rows which span multiple columns. Location should span the table data cells which contain a city and state.

  - The last row of the table (* vice presidential debate) should span all columns.


### How to tackle this project

Decide what you need to do, one step at a time.

Write down each task as you go. When you complete it, check it off. Decide on the next task to tackle.

Once you get into marking up content within the body, it is okay if you get stuck. Set aside that task and move on to another. Note the item you struggled with (so you can spend time on it later) and keep moving forward.

### Am I done?

Again, it is not expected for you to complete this exercise in class.  If you finish, have your professor give it a look.  If you *are* finished, delete your work and code it again. Practice, repetition is an excellent way to learn.

### Why isn't X working?

Before asking for help, try working through the problem first. Refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

When something does not appear to work as you expect, ask yourself:

  - Did I forget to close a tag?
  - Are there typos in element, attribute, value names?
  - Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
  - Are my file names, directory paths correct?

Remember, you can always refer to your notes, book or any resources made available to you for this course.

**Good luck!**
